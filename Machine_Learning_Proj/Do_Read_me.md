# Machine_Learning

.This repository mainly contains my Machine Learning Projects that I undertook to increase myskills in development side of coding

.The First is my implementation of Haar Cascade Classifiers, which were used for Face Detection or specifically eyes and nose detection.

.All of the above XML files were pre-trained Classifiers.

.This was perfectly implemented on Ubuntu 20.04.01. (On Windows it gave some XML file error)

.All the codes are mostly written in Python and used various libraries in Python
